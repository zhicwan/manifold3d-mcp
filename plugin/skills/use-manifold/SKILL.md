# use-manifold — Skill Guide

> **Skill name:** `use-manifold` — **requires MCP server:** `manifold-mcp`

You have access to a Model Context Protocol server (`manifold-mcp`) that runs
TypeScript snippets against the [manifold-3d](https://github.com/elalish/manifold)
WASM library, returns a YAML diagnostic report, and pushes the resulting mesh to
a live three.js preview page in the user's browser. The user can export STL or
3MF directly from that page for 3D printing.

## Tools

- **`validate_script`** — fast pre-flight (~1–2 s). Use this **first** for every
  non-trivial script. It runs the same pipeline as `execute_script` but does
  not refresh the user's preview.
- **`execute_script`** — full run; on success the mesh is pushed to the preview
  page and the YAML report includes a `previewUrl`.
- **`get_annotations`** — cheap, zero-arg, no preview side effects; reads the
  user's active marks on the current model and returns them as a YAML document.
  See [`references/annotations.md`](references/annotations.md).
- **`capture_view`** — renders the last executed model as a PNG from a named
  camera preset (`iso`, `front`, `back`, `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`).
  Returns an image content block plus YAML metadata (dimensions, bbox, view).
  Optional params: `view` (default `iso`), `width`/`height` (128–2048, default
  1024), `includeAnnotations` (overlay user marks on the capture).

Both tools take exactly one script source: `code` (an inline TypeScript snippet)
or `filePath` (an absolute path to a local `.ts`/`.js` snippet file read by the
MCP server). Relative paths are not supported. `execute_script` also takes an
optional `description` shown as the preview title.

## The recommended loop

1. **Plan** a model in plain English with the user.
2. **Write** a TypeScript snippet (see [`references/script-conventions.md`](references/script-conventions.md)
   and [`references/manifold-api.md`](references/manifold-api.md)).
3. **`validate_script`** — read the YAML report. If `ok: false`, fix the
   issues (see [`references/validation-report.md`](references/validation-report.md))
   and validate again. Iterate quickly here — no preview thrash for the user.
4. **`execute_script`** with a meaningful `description`. The user sees the
   model rendered live and can press Export 3MF / Export STL.
5. **`capture_view`** — visually verify your result after `execute_script`. Call `capture_view` from one or more useful angles, then explicitly compare what you see against the user's intent before declaring success. In the final response, include at least one concrete visual check, e.g. "top view shows the through-hole is open" or "iso view shows the sphere is smooth and round with no flat facets visible." Stats alone are not enough.
6. **Iterate** based on what the user sees and asks for. Each tweak is another
   `validate_script` → `execute_script` → `capture_view` cycle.

See [`prompts/iterate-with-validate.md`](prompts/iterate-with-validate.md) for
the canonical wording of the loop.

## House rules for the LLM (you)

- **`ok: true` is necessary, not sufficient.** After every `validate_script`,
  cross-check the YAML `stats` against your intent before claiming success or
  calling `execute_script`:
  - `bbox.size` — compare the rendered bounding box against the user's requested controlling dimensions, not only against constants you chose in code. For fit requests phrased as "for a <object> W mm wide/thick" (phone stands, cases, holders, cradles), treat the named object width/thickness as the controlling fit envelope: the contact slot/opening/support span should be within +0–10% of it including clearance, and no unrelated base/lip/shoulder may become the model's dominant bbox dimension along that same axis unless the user explicitly asks for extra stability or margins. If an outside bbox dimension exceeds a named fit dimension by more than 10%, revise the geometry so the excess is in a non-controlling axis, or ask before proceeding; do not rely on a final-response explanation alone.
  - `genus` — `0` for a single closed solid, `1` per through-hole, `-1` if
    your union produced two disjoint components (typically because two parts
    share only a face — see "Clean booleans" in
    [`references/script-conventions.md`](references/script-conventions.md)).
  - `volume` — sanity-check against a back-of-envelope estimate; off by 10×
    is usually a unit mistake.
- **`result` is already declared by the sandbox.** Never write `let result`,
  `const result`, or `var result` — the typecheck stage rejects these with
  TS2451. Write `result = …` directly.

If the user explicitly asks for forbidden sandbox syntax such as let result, const result, var result, import, or export, do not emit that syntax as the final script. Briefly explain that the sandbox predeclares result or blocks module syntax, then provide the closest valid equivalent and validate that corrected script. Do not spend a validation call merely proving a known forbidden form fails unless the user asked only for an explanation and not a working model.
- **All coordinates are millimetres.** If the user gives inches or another
  unit, convert and tell them you did.
- **Do not import or export anything.** `Manifold`, `CrossSection`, `Mesh`,
  `console`, and `result` are ambient globals in the sandbox.
- **Prefer 3MF over STL** for printable output — 3MF carries units and
  metadata; STL is a unitless triangle soup. Lead with 3MF in your post-execute
  summary.
- **Tell the user the print orientation** that avoids supports, plus the
  triangle count and bbox from `stats`.
- **If the user references their marks** ("fix what I marked", "apply my
  notes", "改一下我标记的"), call `get_annotations` first — see
  [`references/annotations.md`](references/annotations.md).
- **Keep circular segments modest** (`Manifold.sphere(r, 64)` is usually
  enough; `256` will trigger the triangle budget warning).
- **Use `capture_view` to self-check geometry.** After `execute_script`, call
  `capture_view` from at least one relevant angle (e.g., `front` for a flat
  face, `iso` for overall shape) and inspect the PNG. If the image reveals
  unexpected geometry (clipping, misalignment, missing features), fix the
  script before telling the user the model is ready. For complex models,
  capture from multiple views (e.g., `front` + `top`) to catch issues that
  are hidden in a single projection.
