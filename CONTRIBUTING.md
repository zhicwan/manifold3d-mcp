# Contributing

Use Node.js 24 or later and npm. npm installs development dependencies; it is
not the distribution channel for the plugins.

```sh
npm ci
npm run build:plugins
```

## Ownership

Applications compose reusable packages; `skills` is authored content and `plugins`
is generated installation output. The full ownership map and design rationale
live in [Architecture](docs/architecture.md).

Coding agents should start with [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and the applicable local
guidance. Use [Making a good change](docs/change-guide.md) to identify the owner,
affected consumers and appropriate behavioral evidence.

The root `.mcp.json` starts `apps/manifold3d-mcp/dist/manifold.mjs`. Build first.
For local plugin development, load the assembled plugin with the host's
`--plugin-dir` option or install that directory in an isolated host configuration.
Do not replace a user's installed plugin or reload their active Canvas as part
of a build.

`clean` removes temporary build output, not the committed `plugins` directories.
Generated JavaScript and copied references should change only through the build.

Keep the complete lockfile, including optional native packages for other
platforms. If npm produces an incomplete lock from an existing platform-specific
installation, regenerate it with no workspace `node_modules` directories or
old lockfile, then rebuild the plugins. Do not repair CI with extra
platform-specific install commands.

## Skills

Write shared geometry/API material in `skills/shared/references`. Keep the
MCP entry and workflows in `skills/use-manifold`, and the Canvas entry and
workflows in `skills/use-manifold-canvas`.

The build copies each entry and the shared references into that plugin's own
`skills` directory. Duplication in installation output is intentional: either
plugin must work without the repository or the other plugin. Shared filenames
must not collide with host-specific references.

Use ordinary Markdown and relative links within the assembled skill. There is
no macro language or conditional compiler. MCP's `get_annotations` workflow and
Canvas's Fix/Attach workflow are different and should remain explicit.

The sandbox declaration source is
`packages/modeling/src/sandbox/ambient-types.ts`. Regenerate it instead of
editing `.d.ts` copies. Add model examples under `samples/`, use the ambient
globals, and assign the final solid to the predeclared `result`.

## Plugin configuration

The MCP plugin shares `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.mcp.json` between
Copilot and Claude. Its executable is relative to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`,
which both target clients expand. The configuration has no host-only
`type: "local"` or `tools` fields.

Executable location and working directory are different concerns. Copilot
starts plugin MCP servers in the installed plugin directory; Claude can use the
workspace directory. Prefer inline code in plugin tools. Explicitly set
`MANIFOLD_MCP_SCRIPT_ROOTS` to authorize other file roots; never derive an
authorization root by guessing a parent directory. Standalone MCP inherits its
caller's working directory.

The native Extension has a separate manifest, distinct skill name and no MCP
declaration. The GitHub marketplace lists both plugins; the Claude marketplace
lists only MCP.

## Version and release

The root private `package.json` version is the product version. The build
generates plugin/catalog versions and embeds it in the MCP runtime. Both
application workspaces are private.

1. Update the root product version when shipped behavior or content changes.
2. Run `npm run build:plugins` and include source, lockfile, metadata and generated
   plugin changes in the same PR.
3. Merge through the normal review process. Do not use a post-merge bot to
   patch missing generated output into main.
4. Tag that merged commit with the matching `v<version>`.

The release workflow uploads the two already-committed `.mjs` files. It does not
rebuild a different artifact, publish npm packages or update a distribution
branch. Marketplace installs use Git plugin directories, not release asset URLs.
Runtime dependencies must be embedded; the Copilot SDK alone remains external
for the Extension host.

Previously published npm versions remain available but no longer receive new
releases. Migration is an explicit plugin update/configuration change, never
an automatic uninstall or a hidden second MCP server.
